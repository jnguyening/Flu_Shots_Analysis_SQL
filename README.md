# Healthcare Immunization Compliance Analysis

## Overview

Identifying gaps in immunization is a critical task for healthcare providers seeking to improve community health outcomes and ensure equitable care. This project utilizes PostgreSQL to analyze a clinical dataset, defining a specific "eligible cohort" based on age, mortality status, and recent medical encounters. By joining these demographics with immunization logs, the analysis quantifies the 2022 flu shot compliance rate and highlights disparities across various population segments.

The technical implementation features advanced SQL techniques like Epoch-based age calculation and Case-driven feature engineering. The final Tableau Dashboard provides a multi-dimensional view of the data, revealing that while the overall compliance rate stands at approximately 47.91%, variations exist across racial groups—ranging from 53.85% for "Other" ethnicities to 44.44% for Black patients. These insights allow healthcare stakeholders to target specific counties or demographic groups for localized health interventions.
